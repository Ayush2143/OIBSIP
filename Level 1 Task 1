        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h3>Project 1: IoT Home Automation System</h3>
                <p>Developed an Internet of Things (IoT) system to automate home appliances using microcontrollers and
                    sensors. The project includes a web interface for remote control and monitoring.
                    An IoT Home Automation System is a sophisticated network integrating smart devices, sensors, and
                    actuators to enhance convenience, security, and efficiency in a home.
                    Centralized control systems, often through smartphone apps or smart hubs, allow homeowners to
                    monitor and manage these devices remotely. Smart lights, thermostats, and locks
                    exemplify the range of devices that can be controlled, while sensors such as temperature, motion,
                    and light sensors provide data to automate processes.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Project 2: Smart Energy Meter</h3>
                <p>Designed a smart energy meter that accurately measures and records energy consumption, providing
                    real-time data to users for better energy management.
                    A smart energy meter is a digital device that records real-time electricity consumption data and
                    communicates it directly to both consumers and utility companies.
                    By using technologies like cellular signals or radio waves, smart meters provide accurate billing,
                    real-time monitoring, and better energy management.
                    They eliminate the need for manual readings and offer features such as remote access, two-way
                    communication, and enhanced outage detection.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Project 3: Autonomous Robot</h3>
                <p>Built an autonomous robot capable of navigating through obstacles using sensors and machine learning
                    algorithms.
                    The robot can be used in various applications such as search and rescue missions.
                    An autonomous robot is a machine designed to perform tasks without human intervention, using
                    sensors, processors,
                    and actuators to navigate and interact with its environment. These robots utilize sensors like
                    cameras, LIDAR, GPS,
                    and ultrasonic sensors to gather data. Processors analyze this data and make decisions, while
                    actuators enable movement and task execution.</p>
